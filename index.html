        <h2>Riley</h2>

        <img width = 400 src="images/riley_primary.jpg" alt="Apricot goldendoodle wearing blue bandana lying next to ball">
        
        <p>Riley is a 2yr old goldendoodle. He is very active and loves attention. Riley can be pretty mischievous; as such, his favorite activity is begging for (or stealing) food, however getting cuddled on a cool floor comes as a close second. In addition, Riley loves to walk in his local park or hang out with his best friend Cosmo.</p>

        <p>Riley would NOT survive in the wild. He is very stubborn, jealous, and pampered. He’s currently in his “terrible twos,” and must get everything his way. That said, Riley is loved by his family as a perfect, funny, and loyal dog. </p>

    <div><h2>Milo</h2>
        <img width="400" src="images/milo.jpg" alt="Milo, an 8 year old white Maltese family pet">
                <p>Milo, a bashful yet warm-hearted dog, holds a deep appreciation for social interactions, whether they involve humans or fellow pets. Having spent his entire life with the same loving family, Milo's consistent displays of loyalty reflect his strong sense of familiarity and connection. He's known for his charming quirks, such as his penchant for taking a few steps backward instead of a simple turn when changing direction.</p>
                <p>Despite his shyness, Milo's keen senses come to the forefront. At the sound of a passing car, his bark, though more bark than bite, resonates beyond the walls of the house. Interestingly, Milo has never quite grasped the concept of navigating stairs, yet he remains remarkably perceptive about his surroundings. It's this unique blend of traits that makes Milo an endearing presence, leaving a lasting impression on those fortunate enough to share in his companionship.</p>

        <h2>Mocha</h2>

        <img src="images/mocha.jpg" width="400" alt="An upright dachshund with light brown fur and a blue collar staring behind the camera.">
        <p>Mocha is a very energetic little dog. His favorite activities are tug-of-war with toys, playing fetch with his orange ball, and laying on his dad's lap. He has so much energy that in the evenings he tends to 'get the zoomies' in which he sprints in circles around the house without any stimulation.</p>
        <p>When Mocha is done playing, he loves to lay down in an especially silly way. He lays on his belly with his rear paws pointed straight backwards as shown in the following photos. It's his favorite way to recharge after a long day of play.</p>

        <img width="400px" src="images/bo.jpg" alt="Black and white dog sitting on grass.">
        <p> Bo is a Portuguese Water Dog with black and white fur. His paws are white too, so they always get dirty when outside. He is 12 years old, but he still likes to run around outside a lot. </p>
        <p>He has an abundance of toys but only likes to play with a couple. He enjoys going on walks and especially on trails in the woods. He has a few dog friends that he likes to go on playdates with as well.

      <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
      <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

      <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
      <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>
